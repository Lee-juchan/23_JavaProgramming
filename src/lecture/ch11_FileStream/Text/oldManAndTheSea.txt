He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife.
He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach.
They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy.
He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on.

It is beyond being unlucky.
It is a sign of the deepest despair.
Once, when the old man had good luck, they had eaten more than thirty conchs in two days.
But it was the best the luck the old man ever had.
Now, after forty days without a fish, the boy's parents had told him that the old man was definitely and finally salao.
